# KeePass Simple Backup
This is a really simple KeePass Plugin that will save a backup of your Password-Database to a backup location and keep a specific amount of the recent backups (that you can define) every time you save your database or trigger the backup manually.

(However, the originial Database File should not be touched by this plugin. To prevent data loss don't disable the usage of the recycle bin!)
